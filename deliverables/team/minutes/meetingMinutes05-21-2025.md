# **Team Meeting**

## **21 May 2025** / 7:15 PM \- 8:15PM / Tutorial Breakout

# **Attendees** 

Amirali, Madeline, Jaden, Michael, Chelsey, Jin, Kiko (Everyone)

# **Agenda**

## **Discussing Deliverable 1**

1. We delegated the planning.md questions between people and plan to fill it out after meeting with the partner. We also did a puzzle for team building.

## **Meeting dates**

2. We planned to have an in-person meeting after the meeting with the partner on Friday for further teambuilding and more discussion after we find out what the partner requires from us.

# **Notes**

* We should ask the partner if we would be able to do both the frontend as well as the backend, since the scope of the backend looks small enough that we might overlap when trying to do things. 

* We should make more decisions regarding regular meeting times with both the partner as well as each other

* We should have two development managers if we plan to do both the frontend and the backend.

# **Next Meeting Agenda**

Meet with the partner and create the first mockup in an attempt to better understand the goals and the desires of the partner and whether it would be feasible for us. We also should make sure to ask more about the things (like if we can make our repo public, or if they want us to use GitHub issues) that we need to write for the planning.md as well as for the Readme.
