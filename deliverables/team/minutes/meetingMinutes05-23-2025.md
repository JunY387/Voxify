# **Team Meeting**

## **23 May 2025** / 6 PM \- 7 PM / Partner Meeting

# **Attendees** 

Amirali, Madeline, Jaden, Michael, Chelsey, Jin, Kiko (Everyone), and partner (Mehdi)

# **Agenda**

## **Discussing the Partner’s Project**

1. We discussed what the partner wants out of us for this project, what we should expect to do, and how much time commitment we expect to give to the project.

## **Set Roles & Meeting Times**

2. We planned what part of the project everyone would work on (based on partner specifications.md), then set up regular meeting times for 6 PM on Fridays.

# **Notes**

* The partner requested that the DB people work on SQLite or something similar, and that we should worry about api specs, model, and DB schema first before moving on to making a Flask project and configuring gRPC docker based on the schema. 

* We need a bunch of people to try and learn things that they don't know how to do before starting work on certain parts of the project (some people lacking AI, DB, or Security knowledge can learn before we get to those parts of the project).

* The project has no frontend; we are working entirely on the backend, and so for our prototype/mockup, we could make a timeline or chart based on who is doing what and how roles interact. We also created a Slack after the meeting and plan to keep student communications on Discord while communicating with the partner on Slack.

# **Next Meeting Agenda**

Student meetup to finalize Deliverable 1; finish up the planning.md questions as well as the mockup to prepare to submit our first release. We also need to discuss what we should write in the Readme and how to fork the partner’s repository setup under the main school repository.
