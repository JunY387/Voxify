# Voxify

Voxify is an AI-powered backend service for voice cloning and text-to-speech generation. This project focuses on building the core infrastructure, including APIs, model pipelines, data handling, and security. The frontend is not included in this implementation scope and may be developed separately by the partner organization.

## Project Task Management

We use **GitHub Projects** to manage tasks, sprints, and issue tracking. Project boards are updated regularly with development progress and assignments.

---

## System Access & Usage

This project is a **backend service** exposed through RESTful APIs using **Flask**. It is intended to be consumed by external frontend clients or integrated into other platforms.

At this stage, there is no public UI or user-facing interface. API usage documentation will be added in the `D1/mock` directory as the first design, will be evolved while developing.
